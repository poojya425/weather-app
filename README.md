I created this simple weather app to strengthen my front-end development skills and practice working with real-time APIs. It helped me improve my understanding of asynchronous JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and building interactive user interfaces.

Technologies Used
HTML5 – structure of the application
CSS3 – responsive UI design and styling
JavaScript (Fetch API) – handling API calls, dynamic updates, and logic
OpenWeatherMap API – fetching real-time weather data

About the App
This app allows users to search for any city and instantly view the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions with dynamic icons. It also includes simple error handling for invalid city names and provides a clean, responsive UI suitable for both desktop and mobile.
